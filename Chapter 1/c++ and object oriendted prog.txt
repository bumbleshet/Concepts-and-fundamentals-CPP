c++ is not pure ool. c++ is more ojbect oriented than c or pascal, which have no object oriented feautres. or ada. which supports 
classes (packages) and instances however C++ is less object oriented than pure ool c++ doesnt enofre oop apporach. 

friend functions-relaxation to the rule of information hiding
private- cannot be accessed by anyone
public-accessible to every user

private information can be access if the class lists th euser fumctions as its friends

example

class C{
	int n;
	friend int f();
}ob;

function f() has direct access to variable n belonging to the class C, as in
int f(){
return 10*ob.n} \\this could be considered a violation to information hiding principle however class c grants the right to make some what is private and inaccessible 
to others thus because the class has control over what to consider a friend function 
this mechanism , admittedly, is used to facilitate programming and speed up execution, because rewriting code without using frined functions can be major problem
